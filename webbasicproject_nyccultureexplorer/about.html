  <h3>Design, observe, and connect â˜•âœ¨</h3>

  <p>
    Based in New York City, I explore how design and culture shape human experience â€” from quiet cafÃ©s to gallery spaces that merge art, data, and emotion. This project began as a Web Basics assignment for <em>25/FA-INFO-654-08 Information Technologies</em> at Pratt Instituteâ€™s School of Information, where Iâ€™m pursuing my M.S. in Data Analytics and Visualization, and hope to evolve it into a personal archive that connects learning with lived experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of hobbies, my work centers on visual arts, communications design, and data analytics. Iâ€™m interested in how environments influence creativity, wellbeing, and rhythm â€” and how those dynamics shape the way I merge storytelling with analytical structure. My process often sits at the intersection of design systems and human culture, balancing aesthetic clarity with technical precision.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through this project, I hope to document everyday spaces that reflect thoughtful design â€” places where observation turns into insight and inspiration finds meaning in context.
